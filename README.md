📊 Algorithms Explained

  1️⃣ Breadth-First Search (BFS) 🧠
       Time Complexity: O(V + E)
       
  Space Complexity: O(V)
  
  Concept: Explores the graph level by level starting from the source node.

          
  2️⃣ Depth-First Search (DFS) 🔍
        Time Complexity: O(V + E)
        Space Complexity: O(V)
          Concept: Explores the graph by going as deep as possible before backtracking.
          
3️⃣ Dijkstra’s Algorithm 🌐
Time Complexity: O(E + V log V)
Space Complexity: O(V)
Concept: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
4️⃣ Bellman-Ford Algorithm 🚀
Time Complexity: O(V * E)
Space Complexity: O(V)
Concept: Computes the shortest paths in a graph, handling negative edge weights.
5️⃣ Kruskal’s Algorithm 🛠️
Time Complexity: O(E log E)
