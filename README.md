📊 Algorithms Explained

  1️⃣ Breadth-First Search (BFS) 🧠
  
  -Time Complexity: O(V + E)
       
  -Space Complexity: O(V)
  
  *Concept*: Explores the graph level by level starting from the source node.

          
  2️⃣ Depth-First Search (DFS) 🔍
  
  -Time Complexity: O(V + E)
  
  -Space Complexity: O(V)
  
  *Concept*: Explores the graph by going as deep as possible before backtracking.
          
3️⃣ Dijkstra’s Algorithm 🌐

-Time Complexity: O(E + V log V)

-Space Complexity: O(V)

*Concept*: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

5️⃣ Kruskal’s Algorithm 🛠️

-Time Complexity: O(E log E)

-Space Complexity: O(V)

*Concept*: Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph by sorting edges.

6️⃣ Prim’s Algorithm 🌳

-Time Complexity: O(E log V)

-Space Complexity: O(V)

*Concept*: Constructs a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) by adding the shortest edge.
